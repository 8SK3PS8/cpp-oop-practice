This repo was a personal mini-project for me to refresh upon Object-Oriented Programming, but this time in C++!

In this repo there are two folders: pokemon amd library. Each of them contain a simple object oriented implementation of the scenarios.

This helped me refresh over object oriented principles and also refresh over some C++ principles such as shared pointers, and other C++ specific factors.
